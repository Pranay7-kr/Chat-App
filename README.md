# Chat-App
Hi Sir/Ma'am, My name is Pranay Kumar and I am a fresher. I created a simple basic Chat App which have a text box to type the message and a Button/Enter to send the chat. Also, when you double click on message then you can like on message and you can use '@' to mention someone and message them and you can give emojis in the message. And I try my best to create Responsive Web design.

This Website is build using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. You told that I have to create this website using react.js but right now I am learning react.js that's why I didn't use react.js.
